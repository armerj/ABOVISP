This repository contains the ISP hardware, firmware, software and examples to flash the ABOV MC81F4204 in the Pixmob, on the Arduino IDE. [I have documented my journey in building it here](http://jg.sn.sg/ndp-pixmob-1/), and it may help in figuring out what these files do. 

These are all experimental and should not be used in production!

Also good to note: The SS34 diode on the ISP design is somewhat oversized, but works.
